# Chapter-1 : Source Control and GIT

Back to [Course Introduction](../../README.md)

### ðŸŽ¬ [Module 1: Introduction to GIT: Source Control](../../content/source-control/git/README.md)

[GIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is the foundation of DevOps, Programming & Software Engineering </br> 
This is because it is a source code distributed version control system. </br>
In DevOps, you will deal with code, command line, documentation, scripts, automation, intrastructure-as-code and more. </br>
Generally, all of this involves writing files and storing them.
GIT is the system you use to store these files. </br>

In this module we'll take a read through [GIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) to understand where it started and why it is so successful and widely used in software engineering. </br>

#### In this module

* What is GIT
* Installing GIT
* Command line
* Create your first GIT repository
* Branching
* Commits
* Merging branches
* GUI Tools for GIT
  * VSCode


### ðŸš§ðŸŽ¬ [Module 2: Introduction to IDEs: Visual Studio Code]()

When working on source code using GIT, you will want to work on files and directories. </br>
This includes configuration files, code files, scripts and so on. </br>
To get a nice overview of all our files and folders, as well as have access to `git` and command line, we'll use an IDE. </br>
An [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) is an integrated development environment. </br>
It is software that helps us deal with software development and engineering. </br>

#### In this module:

* What is VSCode
* Directory and File management
* Editing files
* Command line terminals
* Extensions
* Themes
* GIT features


### ðŸš§ðŸŽ¬ [Module 3: Introduction to Github: Hosted Source Control]()

Storing source code in a Git repository on a local machine carries a risk of data loss. </br>
If your harddrive crashes, or you lose your laptop, all your work would be lost. </br>
Therefore it's always recommended to use a hosted source control provider like Github, BitBucket, Gitlab and others. </br>

It also makes collaboration possible, when you have a team of people working on the same project </br>

#### In this module

* We create a Github account
* Overview of Github source control
* Integrating our repository with Github
* Working with our repository
